                <p>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Corregidor Island is a natural fortress that is considered to be part of the province of
                    Cavite. Corregidor is a 2-square-mile island located in the 48-km entrance to Manila de bay.
                    During the Spanish colonization, Corregidor island was just a checkpoint to strengthen the
                    defense of Manila along with the port in Cavite city (Fort San Felipe). While the U.S. used the
                    island as a military reservation and they built several structures to combat the Japanese forces
                    when the Japanese invaded the Philippines during WWII (World War II); the built structures
                    includes: ARMY hospital, chapel, school, Malinta tunnel, Mile-Long barracks. Even General
                    Douglas MacArthur chose the Corregidor island as one of his major defense places wherein
                    the Corregidor island eventually became the last settlement of U.S. resistance in the island
                    (Britannica, 2023). Now, the whole island serves as a memorial property for the heroism of
                    Filipino and American defenders against the Japanese forces. According to Inquirerer.net
                    (2019), a company called Magsaysay Shipping and Logistics Group has been providing tours
                    for local and foreign tourists since 1988. The tour activity is called "Sun cruise," it provides a
                    4-hour tour that covers the rich history behind the areas from topside to tail side of the island.
                    The remains of structure, tanks, equipment, and even full-functional structures are still
                    standing and can be explored throughout the island.

                <p>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fort San Felipe or Naval Station Pascual Ledesma or Kuta ng San Felipe, in Filipino,
                    was a port built by the Spaniards in 1609. The port was built with an aim to strengthen the
                    part of the City whilst modified for their ship sizes. Fort San Felipe became part of the
                    prominent historical events before and during the Philippine revolution. One notable event
                    where the port was highly featured was the Cavite mutiny (Ang Pag-aalsa sa Kabite) that
                    happened on January 20, 1872. The Cavite mutiny was a result of the uprising of 200 Filipino
                    military personnel assigned and working in the Cavite arsenal in Fort San Felipe. The
                    described reason for the uprising has two sides: the Filipino workers and Spanish authorities'
                    perspectives. The Filipino workers perspective about the uprising was because of the removal
                    of Spanish authorities of privileges to the workers such as: exemption from the tribute and
                    exemption from forced labor or known as Polo y Servicio (Piedad-Pugay, 2012). While the
                    Spanish authorities claimed that the mutiny was an established plan by the Indios (Filipinos)
                    to set a monarchy government with a Filipino priest leader that will be called "king" as their
                    resistance to the Spanish governance over the country. The Spanish authorities set an eye on
                    the three priests that they believed the mutineer would assign as their leaders, namely: Padre
                    Mariano Gomez de los Ángeles, Padre Jacinto Zamora y del Rosario, and Padre Jose
                    Apolonio Burgos y Garcia or known as GOMBURZA. However, the Filipino mutineers were
                    defeated against the Spaniards and the known mutineers who participated were targeted for
                    execution including the accused three priests. The three priests were executed by using garrote
                    to prevent the revolting nationalistic actions of the Filipinos against the Spaniards (Chandler,
                    1988).
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the execution of the three
                    priests did not silence and feared Filipinos,
                    instead it became a catalyst for further
                    resistance. The Cavite mutiny in Fort San Felipe became an inspiration for Dr. Jose Rizal,
                    wherein he dedicated a sequel to his novel "Noli Me Tangere" (Touch Me Not), titled "El
                    Filibusterismo" (The Reign of Greed) to the three priests that were executed out of
                    accusation. The El Filibusterismo consisted of the Spaniard authorities' doings related to the
                    execution of the three priests and exposed the current situation of the country, which also
                    triggered the Philippine revolution in 1896 (Chandler, 1988). Today, the Fort San Felipe is a
                    nine-hectare port under the administration of Naval Base Cavite and Philippine Navy which
                    provides services such as: ferry services, shore power connections, military housing, and more
                    (Philippine Navy Organization, n.d.).

                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Juan Felipe Monument is located in Cavite city with a historical marker indicating
                    that Felipe was born and raised in the city. Juan Reyes Felipe (1861-1944) was a professor in
                    music and the composer of the Philippine national anthem "Lupang Hinirang" in 1898
                    (Sevilla, 2014). The composition of the "Lupang Hinirang" was under the supervision of
                    Emilio Aguinaldo which by that time had a title "Marcha Filipina-Magdalo" that was inspired
                    by Spain's national anthem "Marcha Real" and France's "Le Marseillaise." The composed
                    instrumental composition was later renamed into "Marcha Nacional Filipina" that was
                    approved by the First Philippine Republic and played by the Banda San Francisco or now
                    known as Banda Matanda of General Trias on June 12, 1898, the declaration of independence
                    of the Philippines. The arrangement of lyrics only followed a year after it was first officially
                    played. The lyrics were derived and adopted from the Spanish poem titled "Filipinas" or
                    known as "Tierra Adorada", written by Jose Palma in 1899. And, the tune of Filipinas was
                    adopted to the instrumental composition of Marcha Nacional Filipina. Several changes were
                    made in the title, and translation of lyrics of the Filipinas as the United States and Japan
                    invaded the Philippines after the Spanish colonization (Galeon, 2012). However, among the
                    translations made, the "Lupang Hinirang" translation by Felipe Padilla de Leon was
                    recognized and came into law in 1998, by then it is sung by the Filipinos when the anthem was played (Andas, 2022).
                    The monument of Felipe has a half body sculpture of his figure surrounded by brick materials along with a historical
                    marker. In the marker, Felipe was said to be the son of Justo Felipe and Victoria Reyes and was born on January 28, 1861
                    in Cavite city. Furthermore, Felipe was arrested along with the thirteen martyrs that were judged of rebellion by the
                    Spaniards during the Philippine revolution, and died on October 02, 1944 in Sampaloc,
                    Manila.

                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Noveleta tribunal or Tribunal ng Nobeletang Kabite is located in Noveleta,
                    Cavite. According to Calario (2018), on August 31, 1896 Caviteno revolutionists targeted
                    three sites: San Francisco de Malabon (General Trias), Casa tribunal in Kawit, and Casa
                    tribunal in Noveleta, to seize weapons and attack the Spanish forces. In Noveleta tribunal,
                    where the NHCP further elaborate the events that happened in the bulwagan; the historical
                    marker indicates that the tribunal place is where Captain Antonio Rebolledo of the civil guard
                    was killed by the member of Magdiwang revolutionary organization, General Pascual Alvarez
                    y de Jesus under the supervision of General Mariano Alvarez as he captured the town of
                    Noveleta. Other personnel were also killed by the revolutionaries. The event is said to further
                    intensify the front of Philippine revolution in Cavite and what became known as the "First cry
                    of Cavite." The Casa tribunal house in Noveleta is formerly municipal hall of Noveleta, town
                    center of authorities during Spanish colonization , became a library, children's clinic, and an
                    office of the Kawanihan ng Rentas Internas of Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR). Nowadays
                    the bulwagan is usually closed for the public under the care of NHCP with them considering
                    the bulwagan to turn into a museum hence the Casa is rich in historical events that was part of
                    the Philippine revolution (Cavite Ecological Profile, 2021).

                <p>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Battle of Imus was one of the major battles that the Filipino revolutionaries have
                    fought in the attempt of independence against the Spanish forces (City Government of Imus,
                    n.d.) and the battle occurred on September 1 to 3 of the year 1896. In the marker of the Battle
                    of Imus or the "Labanan sa Imu"s located in Imus, Cavite, it is stated that Emilio Aguinaldo
                    led the Filipinos for the battle, together with the guide of Colonel Jose Tagle, the leader of
                    Imus. Their forces attacked the forces of Spain, the friars and local garrison of Guardian Civil
                    that stayed in Casa Hacienda de Naic on the first day of the battle. On the second day, Colonel
                    Jose Tagle's men initiated another attack on the force of General Ernesto De Aguirre, leader of
                    Spanish forces (Senate of the Philippines, 2009). In the last day, revolutionaries led by
                    Aguinaldo created a kill zone that close proximity with home-made guns, a small lantaka
                    cannon, and other weapons while making the river banks and stone bridges out of sight of
                    anyone that is approaching the road to Manila (Matic IV, 2020) and this serves as their
                    strategy on winning the fight. In the end, the war was won by the Filipino revolutionaries, and
                    in his rush, General Ernesto De Aguirre dropped his sable de mando that the Filipinos had
                    discovered.

                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Senate of the Philippines (2009), Gardon talked about the Battle of Imus that
                    needed to be remembered since it is "the defining battle of the Revolution". Because of
                    winning this battle, Filipinos had the hope of saving the country and protecting the revolution
                    from dying (Abrina, 2022). Up until now, the Battle of Imus has been a significant battle in
                    our history; it serves as one of the major steps towards the freedom of the Filipinos through
                    the Philippine Revolution, one of the occurrences that strengthens Filipino's bravery.

                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Battle of Alapan took place between 10:00 a.m to 3:00 p.m. on May 28, 1898, the
                    battle between Filipinos and Spaniards lasted for 5 hours. It was the first major success of
                    Emilio Aguinaldo after his arrival back in the Philippines from HongKong and this battle
                    made our heroes proudly raise our Philippine flag for the first time since the colonization of
                    the Spaniards (Malicdem, 2014).
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The monument and the marker of the Battle of Alapan, or "Labanan sa Alapan", were
                    originally placed inside the Alapan 1 Elementary School (Figure 22), but were later moved
                    and already have their own location named Imus Heritage Park (Figure 24). With a
                    40-foot-tall flagpole, Imus celebrates Wagayway (wave) Festival as the flag day every May 28
                    of the year to pay tribute to the many Filipinos who fought and risked their lives in the Battle
                    of Alapan led by General Emilio Aguinaldo. It is also a reminder that the first war of the flag
                    happened in Imus, Cavite (Colocado, n.d ). Emilio Aguinaldo designed the flag that was used
                    on the first rise of the flag, which is the one that the country has been using since that time. It
                    was manually sewn by Marcela Agoncillo, Lorenza Agoncillo, and Delfina Herbosa de
                    Natividad (CAVITEX, 2020).
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Following General Emilio Aguinaldo's directives for the Central Luzon and Tagalog
                    military forces to prepare for war (Ramos, 2016), a total of 6,000 army forces, under the
                    command of Juan Cailles, Mariano Noriel, Artemio Ricarte, and Luciano San Miguel,
                    engaged in close combat using Mauser rifles and bamboo cannons with General Leopoldo
                    Garcia Peña's 2,800 troops in Cavite (CAVITEX, 2020). Even Emilio Aguinaldo, as the head
                    of the revolution, fought close range with a garrison of Spaniard troops (Ramos, 2016).
                    Eventually, Filipinos triumphed, and on the day of the war celebration, we were able to raise
                    our flag for the first time. General Emilio Aguinaldo led it once more, and it was witnessed by
                    Filipinos and 300 Spanish prisoners including General Peña (CAVITEX, 2020).

                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aside from being the bridge that connects the cities of Las Piñas and Bacoor, Zapote
                    Bridge has been a significant place in Philippine history; it was the witness of two historical
                    battles that happened in the Philippines. First was on February 17, 1897 against Spaniards
                    colonialism, and the second was on June 13, 1899 against Americans, making it known as The
                    Battle of Zapote or “Labanan sa Zapote.”
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Emilio Aguinaldo continued to lead Katipuneros in the war between the Filipinos and
                    the Spanish, in 1897, leading his forces in battle against the Spanish troops under
                    Governor-General Camilo Garcia de Poavieja (Philippine News Agency, n.d.). In the
                    Philippines-Spain war, despite Filipino revolutionaries winning against Spaniards, Zapote
                    Bridge witnessed the death of almost 450 Filipinos including General Edilberto Evangelista
                    (MIS Department, 2024), an engineer who became general because of Spanish colonialism
                    (Medina, 2017) that makes Filipinos still lost the battle. 2 years after defeating Spaniards, in
                    1899, the second largest battle in the Philippines happened a battle between Filipinos and
                    Americans that was also witnessed by Zapote Bridge. The clash against Americans was led by
                    Artemio Ricarte and Mariano Noriel (Reyes, 2024). According to the Official Gazette of the
                    Philippines in a report by Nazario (2021), Americans are asserting their claim to control over
                    the Philippines through the Treaty of Paris, which was signed on December 10, 1898. There
                    were 5,000 Filipinos who fought against 3,000 American troops led by Major General Henry
                    Ware Lawton (Berto, 2019). After this battle, the Philippines was colonized by the Americans
                    for almost 48 years (1899 - 1946). Zapote Bridge and its Marker is the way to pay respect to
                    the Filipino heroes who fought for the freedom of the Philippines. It was one of the many
                    proofs of the love and protection that Filipinos can give to their country.

                    Rosario, Cavite, Philippines. The significance of the site is that it directly impacted the
                    Philippines in the event of the Spanish Government. It is at this particular site that the Filipino
                    revolutionary leaders met on the 22nd day of March in the 1897 year for a Tejeros
                    Convention that would lead to more cohesive government. The convention
                    marked the transition from the Katipunan, a revolutionary society, to the formation of
                    the first revolutionary government, with Emilio Aguinaldo elected as President. What came
                    out of the event was the most important problem of internal confrontation among the
                    revolutionaries, but the transition was made for a struggle of independence, notwithstanding
                    the larger picture.

                    Philippine Revolution, thereby understanding the lives of the heroes who fought for the
                    country's freedom and the turn of events that happened on the inside of its walls (Milton,
                    2016).

                <p>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Casa Hacienda de Naic, alternatively spelled as Casa de San Isidro Labrador, is a
                    historic mansion located in Naic, Cavite, Philippines. It is a historic mansion that grew into
                    significance with its history, particularly that of the Philippine Revolution against the colonial
                    rule of Spain. It was turned into a revolutionary headquarters and saw crucial events that
                    signaled this fight for liberty. Of immediate note, however, is Casa Hacienda de Naic, the
                    venue for the April 1897 Naic Military Agreement, in which principal leaders of the
                    revolution, particularly General Emilio Aguinaldo, plotted and then solidified their military
                    strategy. The primary aim of the agreement, after all, was to resolve the internal discord and
                    strengthen the morality of the revolutionaries against the onslaughts of the Spaniards.

                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Casa Hacienda de Naic conserves an architectural heritage that keeps the elegance and
                    functionality of design of Spanish colonial buildings. The land abounds in lush gardens, the
                    strong stone walls, the intricate woodwork designs seemed to breathe the opulence and
                    grandeur that earmarked that specific time. The hacienda is actually enveloped in agricultural
                    greenery, being in the center of revolutionary activities and a testimonial to local agrarian life.
                    It is now a monument to the bravery of the Filipino and Union. It enables visitors to take a
                    journey through time and takes them into rooms full of historical inspirations and displays that
                    tell the story of the revolution. This historical place, aside from memorializing the past, serves
                    as a place of learning for today's generation in the indomitable spirit of the Filipinos to gain
                    their freedom and justice (Coyne, 2016).

                <p>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bonifacio Trial House marks one important testament to Philippine history in
                    Maragondon, Cavite. Inside its walls, one of the most dramatic episodes of the Philippine
                    Revolution unfolds. This is the same place where Andrés Bonifacio y de Castro (1863-1897),
                    the founder of Katipunan, with his brother Procopio Bonifacio, was tried in May of 1897. It
                    was initiated by the Ajenos or foreign judge, of the presiding body because of the on-going
                    internal squabble within the revolutionary movement. Andres Bonifacio—one who was, in the
                    past, a leader of the revolution—was charged with the offense of sedition and treason against
                    the recently established revolutionary government of Emilio Aguinaldo. The whole process
                    eventually ended with the exasperating and still controversial execution of the Bonifacio
                    brothers, a decision remaining one of the most debated until today in Philippine history.

                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The architectural characteristics of the Bonifacio Trial House are of the Spanish
                    colonial residential type, represented by traditional wood structures with capiz shell windows
                    and a very open interior. The house is well-kept to maintain the historical touch of the place
                    for the visitor to experience the environment during the trial. Inside, exhibits and displays tell
                    of distinctive events that, piece by piece, had brought forth the trial, bringing to the visitor an
                    understanding of the highly intricate and troubled labyrinth of the revolution. The Bonifacio
                    Trial House attests to sacrifices and the turbulent journey toward Philippine independence; it
                    gives the solemn reminder of the costs of revolution and of the enduring quest toward national
                    unity and justice (Lamudi, 2019).
